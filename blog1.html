    <h1>The politics of cringe</h1>
    <p class="date">July 3, 2025 | 4 min read</p>
    <p>By winning Bigg Boss, MC Stan, a vexed rapper for his personality, induced a bigger shock than inflation for the elite audience of India. Seema Aunty’s blatant casteism in Indian Matchmaking only compelled upper class viewers to “hate-watch” it – a phenomenon which interestingly generates monetary value for media entities through criticism and mockery. In both cases, the audience was compelled to face realities that they were ought to despise – an experience they had to “cringe” through. If cringing is unbearable, what stops us from looking away? Labeling something cringe if it does not conform to our definition of “cool” is convenient but also revealing of our anxieties. This essay examines the dynamics of cringe through the lenses of Indian pop culture, to contend that the label ‘cringe’ is rooted in mainly social factors and not just limited to economic ones. Cringe is a reaction to unaesthetic content and is worth deciphering who determines what is aesthetically pleasing. Nevertheless, cringe is not just a bounceback at socioeconomic status, it is an attempt at maintaining cultural rightfulness.

        Credits for my initial exposure to Indian Hip Hop go to MC Stan, for his diversified catalog of winning Bigg Boss, showing off his shoes and releasing diss tracks. He often adopts elements of American hip hop into his persona and music by referring to Pune as “P-Town” or mumble rapping. So, this nature integrated with his rapid success might tie a sense of unoriginality with his perception, causing people to insult him. His upbringing in the slums dictate songs like ‘307’ with lyrics like “Rapper log ki gardi kaam mein rap game ka bhai bana shaan pana, mat dikhaa, Joint kaana, maal bana". While reflecting reality, it does not align with cultural class, causing people to visualize a landscape of embarrassment. Lyrical discussion of lifestyles of the slums often incorporates details that challenge national nobleness but at the same time, these lyrics advocate for his "I don't care" attitude as he is so straightforward with them. People attach this attitude with his economical background to mock him and circumvent the learning of the poor economic framework of the country. Cringe, in this case, is particularly utilized to avoid the uncomfortable truth of the economic status of India, and rather direct it towards entertainment.

        The internet has weaponized cringe as an embarrassing label to demean people. The internet even stoops down to using casteist slurs such as “chapri”(Khunteta & Rahman, 2023). The movie “Gully Boy” is celebrated as art for aestheticizing the hip hop culture of the slums. But when MC Stan talks in his local slum slang on the videos he posts online, he is considered cringe and unworthy of his fame (Cardozo & Waghule, 2023). His fault isn’t being from the slums, but for refusing to let go of his roots. This selective embracement of the same culture illuminates that cringe is a tool of social control. Additionally, cheap content is characterized through traits of appearance that throw light on economical backgrounds. There is a clear distinction between the types of content that are labelled as cringe on the internet – specifically social media. Content that is usually low in quality, inclusive of borders, filters, and of performers with an identifiable way of fashion are called cringe (Khunteta & Rahman, 2023). Intriguingly, entering the digital space somehow depends on how we dress. By preconceived notions, neutral colors belong to the elite class whereas flashy and loud colors are exercised by the working class. Maybe in an attempt to escape the matrix of such groundless biases, creators like Puneet Superstar resort to gigs like rolling in the mud or drinking sewage water, as otherwise they lack instruments like branded clothes to compete with elite influencers. Puneet has now made such stunts his brand, highlighting the compulsion he has faced to stay relevant as a result of lacking instruments.

        Nevertheless, to synthesize from the examples of MC Stan and Puneet Superstar would mean to designate socioeconomic background to be the true indicator of cringe. Alternatively, we observe a contradiction in the famous show ‘Indian Matchmaking’ which is mocked for bringing forward concepts of colorism, casteism and misogyny to its audience in today’s era. Despite being set in the posh and wealthy households of Delhi and America, it is characterized as cringe for presenting backward concepts. If only "low-class" people are meant to be embarrassing, why does a Harvard-educated groom make audiences just as uncomfortable as an Indian guy dancing in Connaught Place for reels? Hence, there is an evident motivator of hypocrisy which is equating the levels of disgust caused by elite cringe and social media’s cheap content. This motivator might be a sense of superiority invoked by watching figures like MC Stan and Puneet Superstar fail at social norms, which stems from the pleasure to humiliate “low-class” individuals. Like MC Stan, Seema Aunty encapsulates an “in the face” attitude by outrightly stating the need of an upper-caste and fair groom. Indian Matchmaking mimics a WhatsApp group chat that was never meant to be public. Therefore, mechanisms like “hate watching” are developed to mock socially unacceptable content but on the same line, these hate watchers avoid “dark-skinned” partners or make constant attempts at marrying “within the community”.

        All in all, the truth is, cringe isn’t about wealth. It’s about control. We actually cringe at something that comes off—either too eager, too unaware, or too unfiltered. However, the bias to consume what we despise may not always be deemed hypocritic in nature. Cringe employs irony to discourage backward concepts such as casteism in today’s society. It also offers liberation, allowing MC Stan to absorb “chapri” as a flex and Puneet to make being unfiltered his brand. Simultaneously, it is hypocritical as we tend to marginalize certain creators solely based on their socioeconomic status. By labelling it cringe, we distance ourselves from it, even as we consume it. So the next time we find ourselves cringing, we should reflect on our own biases and ensure that our laughter is genuine and not a way to conceal our discomfort.
