            <p>
                I am currently a 2nd year undergraduate student at Ashoka University studying Computer<br>
                Science, Entrepreneurship and Psychology. Originally from Patna, did my high schooling<br>
                in Trivandrum and currently in Delhi.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                Given the subjects I study, I am interested in business analytics and how technology intersects<br>
                with culture and human behaviour. I love experimenting with new things. Whether it's writing blogs,<br>
                working on small projects or just figuring things out, I enjoy being in the process of learning.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also into audiovisual editing, with proficiency in softwares like Adobe Premiere Pro,<br>
                After Effects, Photoshop, DaVinci Resolve and Audacity. I have been self learning it for 7+<br>
                years. Currently trying to learn Blender, FL Studio and GarageBand. I am also a music<br>
                enthusiast with special interest in the genre of rap and hip hop. This is what most of my<br>
                blogs will be about.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                I have been playing tennis for 10 years. In addition, I am trying to find new ways to move<br>
                with calesthenics and strength training. I also like travelling.
